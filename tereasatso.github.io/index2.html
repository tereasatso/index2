<p>My paintings are primarily about capturing the skies, foothills, mountains, waters and forests of the California landscape. I find inspiration for my paintings by exploring rural trails, in search of interesting subjects and beautiful moments of light.</p>  

<p>Nature is what speaks to me.</p>  

<p>Growing up in rural Michigan, I frequently explored the woods and fields that surrounded our house.  I could hike all day, discovering nature’s treasures with my field guide, journal, and lunch in tow.  That is where my love for nature began and the art of seeing and listening to its music. And the music I heard from nature was full of worship for its Creator.</p>  

<p>For me, life becomes so simple and clear when I worship with creation and paint.</p>

<p>I prefer plein air painting—a great excuse to get outdoors for me.  But I also enjoy working in the studio, with my Pandora playlist for company, as I use my field studies and/or photos to create larger studio pieces.</p>   

<p><i>I hope my paintings whisper in your ear and stir up your soul… much the same way nature does when you are outdoors.</i></p>
